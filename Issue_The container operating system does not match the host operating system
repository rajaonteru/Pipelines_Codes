As discussed during our call, your application — built on .NET Framework 4.8 — uses Azure DevOps hosted agents (2022) to build and push Docker images to AWS.
The pipeline started failing on October 15, showing the reported error. After upgrading the application to .NET Framework 4.8.1, the pipeline resumed working successfully.

You wanted to understand what changed in the hosted agent after October 15 that led to the failure with .NET 4.8 and to confirm the root cause.

Root Cause and Scope
After analysing the shared logs and Azure DevOps backend telemetry, I confirmed that the issue was not related to Azure DevOps or its hosted agents, marking the boundary of our team’s scope.

On deeper investigation of your Docker file, I found that the issue originated from the Docker image used in your container.
Specifically, on October 14, Microsoft restructured and consolidated the .NET Framework 4.x container images, which directly aligns with the timing of your issue.
This update caused the observed behaviour and explained why the upgrade to .NET 4.8.1 resolved it.

Preventive Action
To support your proactive approach, I coordinated with the internal team responsible and identified the official platform where you can stay informed about all past and upcoming Docker-related .NET announcements.
You can also raise any questions or issues related to these updates directly there, and the respective engineering team will respond.
